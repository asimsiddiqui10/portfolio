                    SportTriad is designed around a privacy-first knowledge graph that models relationships between athletes, reflections, habits, and contextual signals over time, rather than relying on raw conversational history. Sensitive data is stored as structured, permissioned nodes with explicit ownership and visibility rules across athlete, parent, and coach roles. The knowledge graph enables longitudinal insight and personalization while minimizing data exposure, and AI systems operate only on scoped, derived representations rather than direct access to raw user content. This architecture emphasizes auditability, least-privilege access, and long-term trust, which are critical when building systems for youth users.

                    At American Completion Tools, I worked on building and deploying internal software systems to support operations, data management, and day-to-day workflows. The focus was on translating business requirements into reliable, production-ready tools, with an emphasis on clean data modeling, maintainable backend logic, and usable front-end interfaces. Much of the work involved integrating existing processes into centralized systems, reducing manual overhead, and improving visibility across teams.

The experience emphasized pragmatic engineering—shipping features, supporting users, and improving systems incrementally—while operating within the constraints of a real production environment.

                    I designed a scouting dashboard focused on helping users quickly understand player information without cognitive overload.

The goal was to surface the right information at the right moment, reducing unnecessary complexity while keeping depth accessible when needed.

The final UI emphasizes clarity, consistency, and usability, ensuring the dashboard feels intuitive and reliable in real scouting workflows.
